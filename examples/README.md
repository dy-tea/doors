# Doors Configuration Documentation

Doors uses two configuration files located in `~/.config/doors/`:

- `doorsrc` - Startup script executed when the compositor starts
- `doorshkrc` - Hotkey bindings configuration

Both files use `doorsctl` to communicate with the running compositor via IPC.

## doorsrc (Startup Config)

This file is executed as a shell script at server startup. Use it to configure
initial settings and set up desktops.

### Config Settings

```
doorsctl config border_width <pixels>
```

Sets the border width around windows.

```
doorsctl config window_gap <pixels>
```

Sets the gap between windows.

```
doorsctl config single_monocle true|false
```

When true, monocle layout shows only the focused window regardless of how many
windows are on the desktop.

```
doorsctl config borderless_monocle true|false
```

When true, removes borders in monocle layout.

```
doorsctl config borderless_singleton true|false
```

When true, removes borders for singleton windows.

```
doorsctl config smart_gaps true|false
```

When true, window gaps are disabled when there is only one tiled window on the
desktop.

```
doorsctl config smart_borders true|false
```

When true, window borders are hidden when there is only one tiled window on the
desktop.

```
doorsctl config focus_wrapping true|false
```

When true, directional focus wraps around when there is no window in the target
direction (e.g., focusing west from the leftmost window wraps to the rightmost).

```
doorsctl config focus_on_activate focus|none|smart|urgent
```

Controls what happens when a window requests activation (new window mapping, XDG activation, `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW`, foreign toplevel requests).

- **focus** (default): The requesting window receives keyboard focus immediately.
- **none**: Activation only updates visual state (borders, tab highlights) without stealing keyboard focus.
- **smart**: The window receives keyboard focus only if it is on the currently focused desktop. Otherwise, only visual state is updated.
- **urgent**: The window is marked as urgent (visual indicator) instead of receiving keyboard focus.

```
doorsctl config gapless_monocle true|false
```

When true, windows are rearranged to fill gaps when windows are closed.

```
doorsctl config decoration_mode none|tabs|always|csd
```

Controls how window decorations (titlebars, borders) are displayed:

- **none**: All windows render without decorations by signaling them to enter fullscreen mode. Tab bars are also hidden. Provides a clean, minimal interface.

- **tabs**: Tab bars are shown in tabbed layouts, but clients are kept in fullscreen mode to hide client-side decorations. No CSD is visible anywhere.

- **always** (default): Decorations are always visible. In tabbed layouts, server-side tab bars replace client decorations. Outside tabbed layouts, clients use their own CSD.

- **csd**: Client-side decorations are always shown, even in tabbed layouts. Tab bars are hidden and every window draws its own decorations.

```
doorsctl config edge_scroller_pointer_focus true|false
```

When true, pointer focus affects scroller behavior at edges.

```
doorsctl config scroller_default_proportion <value>
```

Sets the default proportion for scroller layout (0.1-1.0).

```
doorsctl config scroller_default_proportion_single <value>
```

Sets the default proportion for a single window in scroller layout (0.1-1.0).

```
doorsctl config scroller_proportion_preset [<values>]
```

Sets preset proportions for scroller layout (comma-separated).

```
doorsctl config scroller_focus_center true|false
```

When true, the focused window is centered in the scroller viewport.

```
doorsctl config scroller_prefer_center true|false
```

When true, scroller layout prefers centering the focused window.

```
doorsctl config scroller_prefer_overspread true|false
```

When true, scroller layout prefers spreading windows to fill available space.

```
doorsctl config scroller_ignore_proportion_single true|false
```

When true, proportion settings are ignored for single-window scroller desktops.

```
doorsctl config scroller_structs <n>
```

Sets the number of visible scroller structs (non-negative integer).

```
doorsctl config tab_color_bar_bg "R G B A"
```

Sets tab bar background color for tabbed layout.

```
doorsctl config tab_color_bg "R G B A"
```

Sets inactive tab background color.

```
doorsctl config tab_color_bg_active "R G B A"
```

Sets active tab background color.

```
doorsctl config tab_color_text "R G B A"
```

Sets inactive tab text color.

```
doorsctl config tab_color_text_active "R G B A"
```

Sets active tab text color.

```
doorsctl config tab_color_sep "R G B A"
```

Sets tab separator color.

Each tab color value is four space-separated floats in the range `0.0-1.0` (`R G B A`).

```
doorsctl config text_font "<font description>"
```

Sets the default Pango font description used for compositor-rendered text (for example: `"Sans 10"` or `"JetBrains Mono 11"`).

```
doorsctl config text_height <pixels>
```

Sets the default text height in pixels used for compositor-rendered text.

```
doorsctl config focus_follows_pointer no|yes|always
```

Controls whether keyboard focus follows the pointer cursor.

- **no** (default): Focus never follows the pointer.
- **yes**: Focus follows the pointer when moving over a window.
- **always**: Same as `yes`, but also clears keyboard focus when the pointer moves to the background or over non-window surfaces (e.g., bars, notifications).

```
doorsctl config pointer_follows_focus true|false
```

When true, the pointer is warped to follow window focus changes.

```
doorsctl config click_to_focus true|false
```

When true, clicking a window focuses it.

```
doorsctl config allow_tearing true|false
```

When true, windows may use tearing page flips (screen tearing) for lower latency.
This allows the compositor to bypass vertical sync for eligible windows.
Can be overridden per-window via window rules (see below).
Per-output tearing is configured separately via `doorsctl output <name> tearing on|off`. Default: false.

```
doorsctl config minimize_to_scratchpad true|false
```

When true, clicking the minimize button in the toplevel's decorations sends it to the scratchpad.

```
doorsctl config directional_focus_tightness <0-100>
```

Sets how tightly directional focus navigation favors close windows. 0=least strict, 100=most strict.

```
doorsctl config record_history true|false
```

When true, focus history is recorded for cycling through previous windows.

```
doorsctl config mapping_events_count <n>
```

Sets the number of recent mapping events to track (non-negative integer).

```
doorsctl config ignore_ewmh_fullscreen <0-2>
```

Controls how EWMH fullscreen requests are handled: 0=honor, 1=ignore, 2=auto.

```
doorsctl config split_ratio <value>
```

Sets the default split ratio for new containers (0.0-1.0).

```
doorsctl config automatic_scheme longest_side|alternate|spiral
```

Sets the automatic tiling scheme: `longest_side` splits the largest container, `alternate` alternates direction, `spiral` spirals.

```
doorsctl config initial_polarity first_child|second_child
```

Sets the initial insertion side for new windows (first_child=left/top, second_child=right/bottom).

```
doorsctl config top_padding <pixels>
```

Sets the top padding (margin) for all desktops.

```
doorsctl config right_padding <pixels>
```

Sets the right padding for all desktops.

```
doorsctl config bottom_padding <pixels>
```

Sets the bottom padding for all desktops.

```
doorsctl config left_padding <pixels>
```

Sets the left padding for all desktops.

```
doorsctl config normal_border_color <color>
```

Sets the border color for unfocused/inactive windows.

```
doorsctl config active_border_color <color>
```

Sets the border color for the active window within a container.

```
doorsctl config focused_border_color <color>
```

Sets the border color for the focused window.

```
doorsctl config presel_feedback_color <color>
```

Sets the color of the preselection feedback indicator.

```
doorsctl config tiling_drag_indicator_color <color>
```

Sets the color of the tiling drag overlay indicator (default: `4d9eff4d`).

```
doorsctl config normal_border_gradient <colors...> [angledeg]
doorsctl config active_border_gradient <colors...> [angledeg]
doorsctl config focused_border_gradient <colors...> [angledeg]
```

Sets a linear gradient border that replaces the solid border color for the respective state. The value is a space-separated list of hex `RRGGBB` or
`RRGGBBAA` color stops, optionally followed by a rotation angle (e.g. `90deg`). A gradient with at least 2 stops is required; use `clear` to
reset back to the solid border color.

Examples:
```
# Red -> Blue gradient at 45° angle
doorsctl config focused_border_gradient ff0000 0000ff 45deg

# Red -> Blue -> Green gradient at 0° angle
doorsctl config focused_border_gradient ff0000 0000ff 00ff00

# Reset to solid color
doorsctl config focused_border_gradient clear
```

```
doorsctl config normal_border_gradient2 <colors...> [angledeg]
doorsctl config active_border_gradient2 <colors...> [angledeg]
doorsctl config focused_border_gradient2 <colors...> [angledeg]
```

Sets a secondary gradient that blends with the primary gradient via the
corresponding `_lerp` setting. Same format as the primary gradient.

```
doorsctl config normal_border_gradient_lerp <0.0-1.0>
doorsctl config active_border_gradient_lerp <0.0-1.0>
doorsctl config focused_border_gradient_lerp <0.0-1.0>
```

Controls the blend between the primary and secondary gradient. `0.0` shows
only the primary gradient, `1.0` shows only the secondary. Linear
interpolation is applied between the two.

### Output/Desktop Setup

```
doorsctl output <name> desktops <name1> <name2> ...
doorsctl output <name> -d <name1> <name2> ...
```

Configures desktops on the focused output. Desktop names are space-separated.
The number of desktops is determined by the number of names provided.

## doorshkrc (Hotkey Config)

Hotkeys are defined with one key binding per line, followed by indented command(s).

Format:
```
<modifiers> + <key>
	<command>
```

### Modifiers

- `alt` - Alt key (Mod1)
- `ctrl` or `control` - Control key
- `shift` - Shift key
- `super` or `Mod4` - Super/Win key
- `mod4` - Mod4 key

Combine modifiers with `+`, e.g., `alt + shift + q`

### Mouse Button Bindings

Mouse buttons can be used in hotkey bindings for both custom commands and built-in interactions on floating windows.

#### Mouse Button Names

- `mouse_left` - Left mouse button
- `mouse_right` - Right mouse button
- `mouse_middle` - Middle mouse button (scroll wheel click)
- `mouse_back` - Back button
- `mouse_forward` - Forward button

#### Floating Window Interactions

When holding Alt with a mouse button on a floating window, doors provides built-in interactive operations:

```
alt + mouse_left   # Interactive move (drag to reposition)
alt + mouse_right  # Interactive resize (drag to resize, edges detected from cursor position)
```

The resize operation detects which edge(s) to resize based on cursor position (10px border threshold), defaulting to bottom-right if clicking in the center.

#### Custom Mouse Button Binds

Mouse buttons can also be used with modifiers for custom keybinds:

```
alt + ctrl + mouse_right
	foot
```

### Commands

All commands use the `doorsctl` prefix. Commands not starting with `doorsctl` are executed as shell commands.

```

#### Window Rules

Window rules allow you to control how specific applications are managed when they open.

```
doorsctl rule -a <app_id> [options...]  # Add a new rule
doorsctl rule -r <index>                # Remove rule by index
doorsctl rule -l                        # List all rules
```

**Adding Rules (`-a` / `--add`):**
Specify an app_id (or title) followed by consequence options:

```
doorsctl rule -a dev.zed.Zed desktop=I
doorsctl rule -a zen desktop=II
doorsctl rule -a vesktop desktop=III
```

**Consequence Options:**

- `desktop=<name>` - Send window to specified desktop (e.g., `desktop=I`, `desktop=^1` for first desktop on monitor 1)
- `monitor=<name>` - Send window to a specified monitor (e.g. `monitor=HDMI-A-1`, `monitor=eDP-1`)

```
doorsctl rule -a title="Exact Window Title" desktop=I
```

**Examples:**

```
# Send Zed to desktop I, don't switch focus away from current desktop
doorsctl rule -a dev.zed.Zed desktop=I follow=off

	<command>
```

#### Gesture Types

- `swipe` - Multi-finger swipe gesture
- `pinch` - Multi-finger pinch gesture
- `hold` - Multi-finger hold gesture

#### Fingers

- `1` to `5` - Number of fingers
- `*` - Any number of fingers (use `*` literally)

#### Directions

Swipe directions:
- `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`

Pinch directions:
- `inward` - Fingers moving together
- `outward` - Fingers moving apart
- `clockwise` - Fingers rotating clockwise
- `counterclockwise` - Fingers rotating counter-clockwise

Combine multiple directions with `+`, e.g., `left+up`

#### Examples

# Hold to show desktop (any fingers)
gesture hold:*
	doorsctl desktop -f -l prev
```

### Hot Corner Bindings

Hot corner bindings trigger when the cursor enters a corner region of the focused output. They provide a convenient way to execute commands by moving the mouse to screen corners.

Format:
```
hotcorner topleft|topright|bottomleft|bottomright
	<command>
```

### Animation Settings

Doors supports per-type animation configuration with custom bezier curves.

```
doorsctl config enable_animations true|false
```

Globally enable or disable all animations (default: false).

```
doorsctl bezier <name> <p1x> <p1y> <p2x> <p2y>
```

Register named cubic bezier curves for use as animation easing functions. A cubic bezier is defined by two control points - P0=(0,0) and P3=(1,1) are implicit.

- `<name>` - Name to reference this curve by
- `<p1x> <p1y>` - First control point (x and y, 0.0-1.0)
- `<p2x> <p2y>` - Second control point (x and y, 0.0-1.0)

Built-in curves:

| Name          | Equivalent CSS                     |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| `default`     | `cubic-bezier(1/3, 1, 2/3, 1)`     |
| `linear`      | `cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1)`         |
| `ease`        | `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1)` |
| `ease_in`     | `cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 1, 1)`      |
| `ease_out`    | `cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1)`      |
| `ease_in_out` | `cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1)`   |

#### Global Animation Defaults

```
doorsctl config animation_bezier [<name>]
```

Get or set the global default bezier curve used for all animations when no
per-type override is configured.

```
doorsctl config animation_duration [<ms>]
```

Get or set the global default animation duration in milliseconds (default: 180).

#### Per-Type Animation Configuration

Each animation type can have its own bezier curve and duration, overriding the global defaults. The animation types are:

| Type              | Description                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `geometry`        | Window movement and position changes |
| `resize`          | Snapshot window resize animations    |
| `fade_in`         | Windows appearing (fade in)          |
| `fade_out`        | Windows closing (fade out)           |
| `fade_in_layer`   | Layer surfaces appearing             |
| `fade_out_layer`  | Layer surfaces closing               |
| `workspace_slide` | Workspace switching slide            |


```
doorsctl config animation <type> bezier <name>
```

Set a per-type bezier.

```
doorsctl config animation <type> duration <ms>
```

Set a per-type duration (ms).

```
doorsctl config animation <type>
```

Query the current config for a type.

```
doorsctl config animation <type> bezier ""
```

Clear a per-type override (revert to global default).

```
doorsctl config animation <type> enabled [true|false]
```

Enable or disable a specific animation type independently. When disabled, the animation is skipped entirely.

#### Custom Spring Curves

Spring curves use a damped harmonic oscillator model for physics-based
animations. Unlike bezier curves (which have a fixed duration), springs
naturally settle based on their parameters — they can overshoot, bounce,
and feel more organic.

```
doorsctl spring <name> <stiffness> <damping> [mass] [value_eps] [velocity_eps]
```

- `<name>` - Name to reference this spring by
- `<stiffness>` - Pull-back force (higher = snappier)
- `<damping>` - Energy dissipation (higher = less bounce)
- `[mass]` - Inertia (higher = slower/heavier, default: 1.0)
- `[value_eps]` - Position settle threshold (default: 0.001)
- `[velocity_eps]` - Velocity settle threshold (default: 0.001)

Built-in springs:

| Name       | Stiffness | Damping | Mass | Character              |
|------------|-----------|---------|------|------------------------|
| `default`  | 300       | 20      | 1    | Snappy, no overshoot   |
| `bouncy`   | 400       | 10      | 1    | Fast with bounce       |
| `gentle`   | 100       | 15      | 1    | Soft and smooth        |
| `slow`     | 50        | 10      | 2    | Heavy                  |

Example:

```
doorsctl spring snappy 500 15 1          # Very fast, slight overshoot
doorsctl spring floaty 80 5 3            # Heavy, bouncy
```

#### Per-Type Spring Configuration

When a spring is assigned to an animation type, it takes priority over any
bezier curve - the animation runs until the spring settles, ignoring the
duration entirely.

```
doorsctl config animation <type> spring <name>
```

```
doorsctl config animation <type> spring ""     # Clear spring, revert to bezier
```

### Blur Settings

Doors supports window background blur effects using OpenGL shaders. Three blur algorithms are available: `kawase` (default), `gaussian`, and `box`.

```
doorsctl config blur_enabled true|false
```

Enables or disables the blur effect (default: true).

```
doorsctl config blur_algorithm none|kawase|gaussian|box|refraction|lens_refraction
```

Sets the blur algorithm (default: kawase). `refraction` and `lens_refraction` apply a glass-like distortion effect (see Refraction Settings).

```
doorsctl config blur_passes <n>
```

Sets the number of blur passes (1-10, default: 1). Higher values create stronger blur but require more GPU processing.

```
doorsctl config blur_radius <value>
```

Sets the blur radius (default: 5.0). Higher values create stronger blur but may cause artifacts.

```
doorsctl config blur_downsample 4
```

Sets the blur downsample, can be between 1-8 (default: 4).

```
doorsctl config blur_vibrancy <value>
```

Enhances color saturation in blurred areas (0.0-1.0, default: 0.0). Supported for gaussian and box blur algorithms.
Higher values create more vivid, saturated colors in the blur effect.

```
doorsctl config blur_vibrancy_darkness <value>
```

Controls how much dark/dim colors are boosted by vibrancy (0.0-1.0, default: 0.5). Only applies when vibrancy is enabled.

```
doorsctl config blur_noise_strength <value>
```

Adds noise dithering to reduce banding artifacts in smooth gradients (0.0-1.0, default: 0.0). Supported for kawase blur.
Higher values add more visible noise/grain to reduce banding.

```
doorsctl config blur_brightness <value>
```

Adjusts the brightness of blurred areas (0.5-2.0, default: 1.0).

```
doorsctl config blur_contrast <value>
```

Adjusts the contrast of blurred areas (0.5-2.0, default: 1.0).

### Mica Settings

Mica is a background effect that captures and tints the content behind windows.

```
doorsctl config mica_enabled true|false
```

Enables or disables mica effect (default: false).

```
doorsctl config mica_tint_strength <value>
```

Sets the tint strength for mica effect (0.0-1.0, default: 0.35).

```
doorsctl config mica_tint <R> <G> <B> [A]
```

Sets the tint color for mica effect (default: 0.12 0.12 0.14 1.0). RGBA values should be in the range 0.0-1.0.

### Acrylic Settings

Acrylic is a background effect that applies blur with a tinted overlay and subtle noise texture, simulating frosted glass.

```
doorsctl config acrylic_tint <R> <G> <B> [A]
```

Sets the tint color for acrylic effect (default: 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0). RGBA values should be in the range 0.0-1.0.

```
doorsctl config acrylic_tint_strength <value>
```

Sets the tint strength for acrylic effect (0.0-1.0, default: 0.3).

```
doorsctl config acrylic_noise_strength <value>
```

Sets the noise/grain strength for acrylic effect (0.0-1.0, default: 0.02).

```
doorsctl config acrylic_light_anchor <A> <B>
```

Sets the light anchor pos, (default: 0.5 0.5). Values should be in range -1.0 to 1.0.

```
doorsctl config acrylic_blur_passes <n>
```

Sets the number of blur passes for acrylic effect (0-10, default: 4). Higher values create stronger blur.

### Refraction Settings

Refraction creates a glass-like distortion effect on blurred backgrounds, similar to the "Better Blur DX" KWin effect.

```
doorsctl config refraction_strength <0.0-30.0>
```

Sets the refraction distortion strength (default: 8.0).

```
doorsctl config refraction_edge_size_px <0.0-400.0>
```

Sets the edge glow/lighting effect size in pixels (default: 230.0).

```
doorsctl config refraction_corner_radius_px <0.0-400.0>
```

```
doorsctl config refraction_normal_pow <0.0-8.0>
```

Sets the power/exponent for the refraction normal map (default: 4.0).

```
doorsctl config refraction_rgb_fringing <0.0-1.0>
```

Sets the chromatic aberration (RGB color fringing) strength (default: 0.15).

```
doorsctl config refraction_texture_repeat_mode <0|1>
```

Texture repeat mode: 0=clamp, 1=mirrored repeat (default: 1).

```
doorsctl config refraction_offset <0.0-8.0>
```

Sets the refraction offset value (default: 3.0).

### Screen Shaders

Screen shaders display as a filter above content. GLSL fragment shaders are supported.

```

```

### Keyboard Grouping Commands

```
doorsctl keyboard_grouping none|smart|default
```

Set keyboard grouping mode.

### Scroller Commands

```
doorsctl scroller proportion <value>          # Set proportion for focused scroller client
doorsctl scroller stack                       # Stack focused client with previous
doorsctl scroller unstack                     # Unstack focused client from its stack
doorsctl scroller resize <delta>              # Resize focused scroller client width by delta
doorsctl scroller set_proportion <value>      # Set scroller proportion (0.1-1.0)
doorsctl scroller cycle_preset                # Cycle to next proportion preset
doorsctl scroller center                      # Center focused scroller window in viewport
```

### Master-Stack Commands

Master-stack layout splits the desktop into a master area (containing N windows) and a stack area (containing the remaining windows).

```
doorsctl master_stack cycle_orientation      # Cycle orientation: left, top, right, bottom
doorsctl master_stack cycle_stack_layout     # Toggle stack area between vertical/horizontal
doorsctl master_stack inc                    # Increase the number of master windows
doorsctl master_stack dec                    # Decrease the number of master windows
doorsctl master_stack flip                   # Flip master side (left to right, top to bottom)
doorsctl master_stack set_count <n>          # Set master count to n (1-10)
doorsctl master_stack set_ratio <0.1-0.9>    # Set master/stack split ratio
```

The master area is sized according to the configured ratio (default 0.5). The orientation controls which side the master is on. When only one window is present, it takes the full area regardless of the ratio. Use focus and swap binds (west/east) to move between master and stack.

### Hotkey Commands

Add or list keybinds on the fly without editing `doorshkrc`. Keybinds added this way are active immediately and use the same parsing as the config file.

```
doorsctl hotkey list
```

List all currently registered keybinds. Tab-separated columns: index, modifier combination, key name, and action (built-in name or external shell command).
Submap membership is shown in brackets (e.g. `focus_west [submap: focus]`).

```
doorsctl hotkey <modifiers+key> <command> [args...]
```

Register a new keybind at runtime. The `<modifiers+key>` syntax matches
`doorshkrc` (e.g. `alt+d`, `super+shift+Return`). The command and its
arguments are joined and parsed the same way as the config file - commands
prefixed with `doorsctl` are mapped to built-in actions; anything else is
executed as a shell command.

Examples:

```
doorsctl hotkey "alt+d" doorsctl desktop --focus next
doorsctl hotkey "super+Return" foot
doorsctl hotkey "alt+shift+l" doorsctl toggle floating
doorsctl hotkey "ctrl+alt+t" doorsctl node --state tiled
```

### Equalize/Balance Commands

```
doorsctl equalize # Equalize window sizes in tree
doorsctl balance  # Balance window sizes in tree
```

### Primary selection

Primary selection (middle mouse paste) is enabled by default. To disable it, add the enviroment variable `DOORS_DISABLE_PRIMARY_SELECTION=1` to your environment before doors launches. Do not put this in the `doorsrc` as those commands run after primary selection is set up.
